# Spacecraft Cyber-security

Spacecrafts and satellite systems are widely deployed in commercial and military applications because of their usefulness in intelligence collection by nation-states, in addition to being used in the tracking systems such as the Global Positioning System. However, spacecraft and satellites use designs and standards that were developed several decades ago in the 1970s. This subjects them to a significant range of modern cyber-attacks and threats. Thus, there is a need for developing a security and monitoring system that could identify the cyber threats as well as monitor any system anomalies and mitigate those threats with complete autonomy to regain normalcy of operation. In this project, a testbed is built that emulates the behavior of a satellite system to demonstrate different cyber-attacks and how these cyber-attacks and threats are identified by the security monitor.

## For documentation on setting up testbed please visit wiki page of this project. Documentation for each module can be found in the respective directories README files.

Below is the functional block diagram of the project. Each module should be loaded to the respective hardware shown as in the diagram below.
